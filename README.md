# Collection of Ansible filters I have written.

Every Plugin type will contain a basic README.md, that shows the various plugins and a basic example of each one. I will blog about each type of plugins, that I post here and how I use them.

# AWS Filter Plugins
* Place the filter_plugins directory into the root of your playbook directory. If your playbooks live in ```/etc/ansible/playbooks```, than it should look like this ```/etc/ansible/playbooks/filter_plugins/aws.py```
